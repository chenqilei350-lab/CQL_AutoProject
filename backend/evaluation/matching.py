"""
Matching strategies — how to compare extracted vs. expected values.

Each strategy returns a score between 0.0 (no match) and 1.0 (perfect match).
Different strategies are appropriate for different field types:
  - Exact: IDs, enums, booleans
  - Normalized: names, labels
  - Token overlap: descriptions, free text
  - Embedding similarity: semantically equivalent but differently worded
